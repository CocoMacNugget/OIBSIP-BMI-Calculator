# OIBSIP-BMI-Calculator

## Idea: BMI Calculator

**Project Description:**

**For Beginners:** Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their
weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories
(e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and
category to the user.

**For Advanced:** Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using
libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Allow users to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and
visualize the result. Enable data storage for multiple users, historical data viewing, and BMI
trend analysis through statistics and graphs.

## Key Concepts and Challenges:

1.User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors
gracefully.

2.BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.

3.Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges. 

4.GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result
displays.

5.Data Storage (for Advanced): Implement user data storage, possibly using file storage or a
small database.

6.Data Visualization (for Advanced): Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts.

7.Error Handling (for Advanced): Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval. 

8.User Experience (for Advanced): Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear
instructions and feedback.

## Brief overview of my project:

As part of my internship program at Oasis Infobyte, I choose the beginners part. I made a console-based
BMI Calculater that will allow the user to enter their weight (in kg) and their height (in m). The user
will the receive their BMI and what category they fall under (whether underweight, normal, overweight or 
obese).
